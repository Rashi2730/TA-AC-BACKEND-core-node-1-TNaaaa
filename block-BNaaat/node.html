    <h1>ABOUT HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for hyper text markup language â€“ it is used to display web
      pages on the browser. In order to create web pages, one should learn HTML.
      <br />
      As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language, not a programming
      language. This means that we do not write programs using HTML; instead,
      markup language is mainly used to apply layout and formatting conventions
      to a text document. In other words, markup language makes text more
      interactive and dynamic.
